## Code of Conduct

We use the [software carpentries code of conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html).  
In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviours in all platforms and events:

- Use welcoming and inclusive language
- Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Show courtesy and respect towards other community members


### Reporting 

If someone makes you or any other contributor feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report this in a timely manner. Code of conduct violations reduce the value of the community for everyone and we take them seriously. 
If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct, we ask that you report it to the workshop organisers or fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeID-DiFMbXAHFeeiNgPKiCoa3FwA5I_92xE9cqlZB-3J49zA/viewform?c=0&w=1).
